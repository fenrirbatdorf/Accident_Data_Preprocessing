CFD COMPARISONS TO BE TRIED
ONE VS MANY:
- CLASS 1 vs CLASS 2/3/4
- CLASS 2 vs CLASS 1/3/4
- CLASS 3 vs CLASS 1/2/4
- CLASS 4 vs CLASS 1/2/3

- Merge CLASS 1/2 and 3/4, compare

- Remove CLASS 1, DO NOT MERGE CLASSES:
- CLASS 2 vs CLASS 3/4
- CLASS 3 vs CLASS 2/4
- CLASS 4 vs CLASS 2/3


- MAKE CHARTS TO VISUALIZE DATA (Need to brainstorm what to plot exactly)
- FOR CFD REASONS, MERGE 1/2 AND 3/4 FOR NOW (Finished)
